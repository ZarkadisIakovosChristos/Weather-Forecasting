# Weather-Forecasting
This repository contains information and material for the Weather Forecasting, a personal project. The purpose of the project is to make forecasting for the temperature of the weather. The project was written in Python. Main tasks where duplicate values detection and removal, missing values detection and removal, statistical analysis (including Density-Histogram-Scatter Plots, Independence Tests, QQ-Plots, Distribution Fitting Tests with Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilks, Anderson Darling, Correlation Analysis with Pearson Spearman, Kendall), outlier detection (with Box-Plots, Z-Score, IQR-Score, QD-Score and DBSCAN), data splitting, data scaling, feature selection (with PCA Mutual Information and SequentialFeatureSelector) and forecasting (with OLS and evaluation with metrics like MSE, MAE, R2, MAPE, SSE, SSR, MSR).
